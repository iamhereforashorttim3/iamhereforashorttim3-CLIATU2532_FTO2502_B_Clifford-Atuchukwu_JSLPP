## Overview:
* We were tasked with finalizing the KanBan app that we have been working on for the last 5
weeks, by adding new features such as a Dark and Light mode, Foldable sidebars, Editing and 
deleting tasks and a dynamic task counter. Using the API provded to us to link the initial
 tasks to the kanban board.

## Initial thoughts:
* I came into this project calm because in previous projects I have already created certain 
features such as the dynamic task counter, but overall I was more excited than anything else
as I saw it as an opportunity to learn new skills and apply them to my practice projects.

## Struggles/What I have learnt:
* The thing that I struggled with the most was tryig to create the folding sidebar
as in random moments would work at the cost of none of my tasks rendering or in some
instances destroying my code completely. Unfortunately I was not able to properly
implement it, so during this upcoming study break I'm going to try and see if there is
a way to properly add it to my code without any issues.
